      <h3>US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson dismissed as "laughable" on Friday reports that his job security is uncertain.</h3>
      <p>But rumours that the White House is considering<b> a plan to replace</b> him because of tensions with President Donald Trump have swirled in Washington DC for months.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, Mr Trump categorically denied the rumours as fake news, saying Mr Tillerson was "not leaving". The State Department has said it is business as usual.</p>
      <cite>The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! Heâ€™s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!</cite>

      <h3>Formula E: 'You never know what's going to happen'</h3>
      <p>It will be a birthday that Daniel Abt will never forget.</p>
      <p>For most of his Formula E career he has watched his Audi Sport ABT Schaeffler teammate Lucas di Grassi take the plaudits, but at Sunday's Hong Kong ePrix it was Abt who stood tallest on the podium.</p>
      <p>The German driver looked destined to finish runner-up in the second race at the opening weekend of the 2017/18 Formula E season as Edoardo Mortara, Venturi Racing's rookie driver, led the way for much of the race.</p>
